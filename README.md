Scientific Question: Because alternative splicing leads to different isoforms for the human Retinoic acid receptor-alpha, could these differing sequences lead to an effect on ligand binding with the receptor?

Scientific Hypothesis: If there are differences between Retinoic acid receptor-alpha isoforms in their sequence, then we could be expected to say an effect on the receptors binding ability to its ligands

The necessary files for the code to run include 

"RARA1_Human.fasta" : The fasta file for the amino acid sequnece of Retinoic acid Receptor Alpha-isoform 1

"RARA2_Human.fasta" : The fasta file for the amino acid sequnece of Retinoic acid Receptor Alpha-isoform 2

"1dkf.pdb" is the protein data bank file(pdb) for Retinoic acid Receptor Alpha-isoform 1
